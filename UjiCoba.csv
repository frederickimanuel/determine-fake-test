"The Bank of England has become the latest British institution to apologize for historic ties to slavery. Several UK companies acknowledged ties to the slave trade this week and pledged new financial support to black and minority ethnic communities. The companies are highlighted in a University College London database exploring the legacies of British slave ownership, which made a considerable contribution to the country's wealth. Britain enslaved 3.1 million Africans between 1640 and 1807, transporting them to colonies around the world, according to Historic England, a public body. Many of these individuals were taken to the Caribbean to work on sugar plantations, which made their owners very wealthy through the export of sugar, molasses and rum, according to the National Archives.
When colonial slavery was abolished in 1833, the British government paid £20 million ($25 million) to compensate slave owners, while the enslaved received nothing. In today's terms that compensation equates to around £16.5 billion ($20.6 billion), according to Historic England.
In recent weeks, Black Lives Matter protests have erupted across the United Kingdom, with demonstrators tearing down a statue of seventeenth century slave trader Edward Colston and calling for the removal of other monuments.
""The slave-owners were one very important means by which the fruits of slavery were transmitted to metropolitan Britain,"" University College London says.
The university's database shows that several former governors and directors of the Bank of England owned slaves. These individuals were compensated by the UK government when slavery was abolished, receiving several thousand pounds in some cases to free their slaves.
A spokesperson for the Bank of England said in a statement Friday that the eighteenth and nineteenth century slave trade was an ""unacceptable"" part of English history and apologized for the role played by former governors and directors. The central bank will take down images of former governors and directors who were involved in the slave trade if they are on display anywhere in the Bank, the spokesperson said.
Churches and cathedrals are also considering how they can address the issues raised by Black Lives Matter when it comes to monuments, the Church of England's director of cathedrals and church buildings, Becky Clark, said in a statement. This may include the alteration of removal of monuments, but this must be done ""safely and legally,"" she added. ""Slavery and exploitation have no place in society,"" said a spokesperson for the Church of England. ""While we recognise the leading role clergy and active members of the Church of England played in securing the abolition of slavery, it is a source of shame that others within the Church actively perpetrated slavery and profited from it,"" the spokesperson added.
The Church of England issued an apology in 2006, acknowledging the part it played in historic cases of slavery. It now works to end modern day slavery through the Clewer Initiative.
Major companies around the world are grappling with how to address racial injustice. British companies Lloyd's of London, the world's oldest insurance market, and pub chain Greene King acknowledged their ties to the slave trade earlier this week.
This year more than a dozen US firms, including Nike (NKE), Twitter (TWTR) and Target (TGT), have given employees a day off work to observe June 19, or Juneteenth, as a paid holiday. Juneteenth marks the day in 1865 when, more than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation, slavery was ended in Texas.","Friday, June 19, 2020"
"China has become one of Africa's largest creditors in recent years, lending hundreds of billions of dollars to governments to build roads, railways and ports. Now it's promising to write off a small part of that debt as countries on the continent battle the Covid-19 pandemic.

China will exempt certain African countries from interest-free loans due by the end of this year, President Xi Jinping said late Wednesday. He was speaking at a summit about how China and Africa can fight the pandemic together.
Xi did not say which African countries would be exempt or how much debt would be erased outright.
By independent estimates, African countries are substantially indebted to China. Some 20% of African government external debt was owed to China in 2018, according to an estimate from the Jubilee Debt Campaign, a UK-based charity group which advocates for debt cancellation for poor countries.
Chinese lenders signed $152 billion worth of loans to African countries from 2000 to 2018, according to a separate report published Thursday by the China Africa Research Initiative (CARI), a research program at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies.""The world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century,"" Xi said. ""Given the new opportunities and challenges we face, closer cooperation between China and Africa is needed more than ever.""
A fraction of what Africa owes
The Chinese leader also promised that his country would offer ""greater support"" to African countries that have been hit hardest by the virus or are under financial stress. He suggested that China could give countries more time to repay other debts, for example.
Xi's announcement comes as the coronavirus pandemic inflicts substantial hardship on some of the world's most underdeveloped countries, including those in Africa — and pressure is building on creditors to step in. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, for example, have been calling on creditors to suspend debt repayments from Africa as a way to support some of the continent's poorest countries as they grapple with fallout from the outbreak.
But analysts have pointed out that interest-free loans comprise just a fraction of the debt that African countries owe China. The CARI report pegged the total at under 5%.
In the early 2000s, such arrangements ""made up a significant percentage of Chinese loans,"" the report said. ""However, as other sources of financing from China started to increase ... [interest-free loans] became a smaller and smaller proportion of China's total lending to Africa.""
Canceling African debt is also not new for China. China erased at least $3.4 billion worth of African debt from 2000 and 2019, according to CARI — mostly in mature, interest-free foreign aid loans that had gone into default.
But the ""vast majority"" of loans China has extended to Africa recently — including concessional and commercial loans — have never been considered for cancellation, the report added.
An important ally
Xi's announcement may be more about politics than it is about forgiving substantial amounts of debt. The president has in recent weeks made the preservation of his country's diplomatic ties in Africa a key foreign policy strategy, as it faces a backlash among some Western democracies over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
China, meanwhile, has viewed Africa as an ally since the Cold War, and the two have become more closely intertwined in the past two decades — especially through trade and foreign investments. The value of bilateral trade has soared twentyfold since 2000, to around $209 billion in 2019, according to China's official statistics.The alliance with Africa has also given China a lot of influence on the continent, which has been a willing recipient of Chinese investment and infrastructure projects through Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative. From 2014 to 2018, for example, China's foreign direct investment in Africa soared by 44% to $46 billion, according to the most recent data from the United Nations' Conference on Trade and Development.
The relationship between China and Africa hasn't been entirely smooth, though. In April, Africans in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou told CNN that they had been evicted from their homes by landlords and turned away from hotels as China's warnings against imported coronavirus cases stoked anti-foreigner sentiment. Chinese officials said at the time that the country had ""zero tolerance for discriminatory words and actions,"" and that ""China and African countries have always supported each other and have always fought against the virus jointly.""
Economic challenges
And the decision to forgive debt comes at a challenging time for China's economy, which earlier this year shrank for the first time in decades.
Recent data suggests that the recovery in China has been slow. Last month, for example, exports dropped as the coronavirus continued hurting the country's major trading partners, causing demand to slump. And recent data about industrial production, investment activity and retail sales — all important barometers of China's economy — has been underwhelming.Even so, Xi said that strengthening the Belt and Road Initiative is important in the wake of the pandemic, and he reiterated that China and Africa share a ""longstanding friendship.""
""No matter how the international landscape may evolve, China shall never waver in its determination to pursue greater solidarity and cooperation with Africa,"" Xi said, adding that Beijing will continue to supply African nations with medical supplies, help them build hospitals and even allow some countries there to be among the first recipients of a Covid-19 vaccine, should China complete one.","Wednesday, June 3, 2020"
"In less than two months, Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani has amassed more than $15 billion in investments to fuel his technology ambitions from the likes of Facebook and top Silicon Valley investors Silver Lake and TPG.

Now he has attracted a powerful new investor with deep pockets: Saudi Arabia.
The kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), will pay $1.5 billion for a 2.3% stake in Jio Platforms, the digital technology arm of Ambani's sprawling conglomerate Reliance Industries. The deal, announced on Thursday, values Jio Platforms at close to $68 billion.
It's the tenth major investment in Jio Platforms since April, when Facebook bet $5.7 billion in one of its biggest ever deals. That deal offered Facebook a crucial foothold in India's fast-growing internet market and further cemented Ambani's position as a kingmaker in the region. The social media company has hundreds of millions of users in India and has already invested heavily into growing its own business, but has run into a series of regulatory hurdles in recent years.
Thanks to the fundraising blitz and a recent $7 billion share sale, Reliance Industries said on Friday that it is now debt free. The company said its net debt at the end of March was 1.61 trillion rupees ($21 billion). Ambani, Asia's wealthiest man, launched Jio as a telecom network in late 2016 and has since signed up 388 million subscribers. Jio also has an ecosystem of apps, offering those millions of mobile users everything from online grocery shopping and digital payments to video streaming.
Analysts say Ambani's ultimate ambition is to build the next global technology company, one that can hold its own against the likes of Google (GOOGL), Tencent (TCEHY), Amazon (AMZN) and Alibaba (BABA).
The backing of the Saudi wealth fund, which has investments in several Silicon Valley firms including Uber (UBER) and Tesla (TSLA), will help Ambani further that ambition.
""I welcome PIF as a valued partner in Jio Platforms and look forward to their sustained support and guidance as we take ambitious steps to accelerate India's digital transformation,"" Ambani said in a statement.
Jio has emerged as the prime conduit to cash in on India's internet boom, with more than 600 million internet users and nearly an equal number yet to come online for the first time.
""We believe that the potential of the Indian digital economy is very exciting and that Jio Platforms provides us with an excellent opportunity to gain access to that growth,"" PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan said in a statement.","Monday, May 18, 2020"
"The Bank of England is throwing more money at the British economy as the country tries to stave off its worst downturn in more than 300 years.

The central bank said Thursday that it would increase its bond-buying program by another £100 billion ($125 billion), bringing the total up to £745 billion ($929 billion). The Bank of England said it will reach that target by the end of the year. The move adds to the trillions of dollars in stimulus already pledged by central banks around the world as policymakers take unprecedented steps to tackle the global recession, falling inflation and extreme unemployment stemming from the pandemic. The Bank of England's purchases of government bonds are helping the UK government to finance recovery efforts as it borrows record amounts.
The country is in particularly rough shape. It has one of the highest coronavirus death tolls in the world and an economy that is only very gradually emerging from lockdown. UK GDP contracted by more than 20% in April, a record, following a 6% decline in March. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned last week that the United Kingdom would suffer the worst downturn of any major economy this year.
There are some signs that consumer spending is picking up as restrictions ease, according to the Bank of England, which held its key interest rate at 0.1%. Yet inflation fell back to 0.5% in May, and the central bank warned that it's difficult to determine the strength of the expected recovery in the second half of the year.
""Even with the relaxation of some Covid-related restrictions on economic activity, a degree of precautionary behavior by households and businesses is likely to persist,"" the Bank of England said. ""The economy, and especially the labor market, will therefore take some time to recover towards its previous path."" There's another huge cloud hanging over the economy and its ability to recover: Britain has set itself a deadline of the end of the year to get a trade deal with the European Union, its single biggest export market. Little progress has been made in talks so far.
The OECD has forecast that the UK economy will shrink by 11.5% this year even if a basic free trade agreement with the bloc is reached and a second wave of infections is avoided.
With the recovery expected to take years, economists predict that more action from the Bank of England will be needed down the line. That's sparked discussion about whether the central bank could opt to push interest rates into negative territory, a controversial measure already deployed by the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan.
""The need to continue supporting the economy will undoubtedly fuel further discussion about whether negative rates are on the horizon,"" James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, told clients Thursday.","Saturday, May 2, 2020"
"June is always a big month for Chinese e-commerce company JD.com. This year it could be huge.

JD.com's most important annual sales campaign — ""618"" — ends Thursday. The three-week shopping event started back in 2004 typically brings in tens of billions of dollars in sales.
This year's campaign, though, is unlike any other in the company's history. The event — which has grown to include JD.com's big Chinese rivals, Alibaba (BABA) and Pinduoduo (PDD) — is one of the most significant barometers yet of how much Chinese consumers are spending as the world's second largest economy slowly recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. it's a big opportunity for JD to prove its role in China's economic recovery and demonstrate that it has moved on from a 2018 scandal involving its CEO. The company is China's second biggest e-commerce company with 20% market share, though it lags far behind Alibaba's 60%. Pinduoduo is third with 10%.
""This moment is pretty important,"" Ling Chenkai, vice president of JD Retail, told CNN Business in an interview earlier this week. ""This is the first nationwide sales event during the recovery of the virus."" So far, Ling said the company has seen ""pretty good momentum,"" nothing that electronic goods, smartphones and beauty products have ""all just rebounded really well.""
""618"" also coincides with the company's secondary listing this week on Hong Kong's stock exchange. It raised nearly $3.9 billion — money that could help it increase its share of China's e-commerce market. JD.com shares in Hong Kong jumped 3.5% in their debut on Thursday. The 'biggest winner' of the lockdown
At the height of the coronavirus outbreak in China, large parts of the country were on lockdown, driving a lot of people to turn to online platforms for groceries and daily goods.
JD was best placed to meet the surge in demand because, unlike Alibaba and Pinduoduo, it has its own logistics and delivery services.
JD's approach is more costly, but it is also more reliable — and its control over the entire network has paid off handsomely during the pandemic.
""Without a doubt, JD is the biggest winner of the pandemic,"" said Bernstein analyst David Dai.
JD and its logistics network were running at near full capacity, even in the worst days of the pandemic, while other e-commerce platforms couldn't fulfill orders, Dai added. Top executives at Alibaba and Pinduoduo acknowledged delivery issues during earnings calls earlier this year because of delays and limits in delivery capacity. Meanwhile, JD's chief financial officer Sidney Huang said last month that the company was able to provide ""undisrupted and timely services to users"" throughout the Covid-19 outbreak.
""As a result, [JD has] won users, they have won orders and the tailwind is helping them not only during the pandemic, but also ... after the pandemic,"" Dai said.
Ling called the pandemic ""a double-edged sword.""
Covid-19 helped the company grow sales in medical supplies, fresh produce and daily necessities, the JD executive said, but demand in other categories was severely impacted, such as home appliances and other big ticket items.
Because the rest of the world is still fighting Covid-19, domestic consumption will be key to China's economic recovery. And early numbers for June indicate that Chinese shoppers are eager to spend.
'618' sales up more than 30%
JD said that sales for this year's ""618"" event topped 269 billion yuan (nearly $38 billion), up more than 33% over last year. The company said online grocery sales doubled over last year, and smartphones and electronic sales also saw big bumps.
At least one of JD's rivals is also seeing positive trends. An Alibaba spokesman said on Monday that categories such as pet snacks, beauty tools and health check devices were showing ""high triple-digit growth this year"" so far. Pinduoduo did not respond to requests for comment.
The Chinese government has also latched on to ""618"" in an effort to spur domestic consumption. Beijing offered government-sponsored coupons to JD users, who could use them to get discounts on items like home appliances or furniture. City mayors used live-streaming to sell local fruits and vegetables.
Coming out of Covid-19, Chinese consumers are spending more time shopping online, and expanding the kinds of goods they buy, said Xiaofeng Wang, an analyst with market research firm Forrester.
More older Chinese shoppers are also trying out e-commerce, she said.
""Previously they didn't shop online, and now they have to,"" Wang said. Older Chinese are now buying groceries online, and they'll likely expand their online shopping habits to other categories, such as clothing and footwear. A Forrester survey conducted in April found that 74% of respondents over the age of 65 in China said they would ""shop much more online in the future."" JD's Hong Kong listing comes as tensions between the United States and China are ramping up. Chinese companies listed on US exchanges are coming under much more intense scrutiny from US lawmakers.
Ling declined to comment on the potential risk to its business should tensions between Beijing and Washington continue to escalate.
""We do hope that there could be a very open and equal environment, global environment, for us to work with other partners, no matter [if they are] domestic or overseas,"" Ling, the VP for JD Retail, said.
The Hong Kong listing is about more than just protecting JD from tensions in the United States, where it trades on the Nasdaq exchange. JD said it will use the fresh money it raises to invest in supply chain technology and improve operating efficiency. JD was founded by billionaire Richard Liu in 1998, and he remains the company's CEO. But since his 2018 arrest in the United States on suspicion of sexual misconduct, Liu has handed control of operations to JD Retail CEO Xu Lei. Minnesota prosecutors decided not to file charges against Liu, who has apologized for his ""interactions"" with a woman and said in December 2018 that he did not break the law.
Liu may have taken a lower profile in the last couple of years but Ling said he's still very present at the company.
""Honestly speaking, Richard is still playing a very important role in the company, and he's also involved in all the strategy and development,"" he said.
Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated how much grocery sales rose during the 618 sales event.","Thursday, April 16, 2020"
"Second Lieutenant Anmol Narang, a second-generation immigrant born and raised in Roswell, Georgia, is the academy's first observant Sikh, meaning she follows religious practices including Kesh, which calls for allowing one's hair to grow naturally without cutting it.
""It's an incredible feeling,"" Narang told CNN. ""It's a humbling experience, I have never worked harder for anything in my life. Being a Sikh woman is a very important part of my identity and if my experience can play a small role in being an inspiration for others, regardless of career field, that will be wonderful."" While other Sikhs have graduated from the academy, the Sikh Coalition has confirmed to CNN that Narang is the first observant Sikh to have graduated from West Point.
The 23-year-old graduate hopes that her efforts to represent her religion and community will encourage Americans to learn more about the Sikh faith, the fifth largest religion in the world. Narang said she decided to apply to West Point to study nuclear engineering and pursue a career path in air defense systems after visiting the Pearl Harbor National Memorial in Honolulu, Hawaii.
Her graduation marks an incredible success for Sikh Americans. In 1987, Congress passed a law prohibiting various religious communities, including Sikhs, from practicing certain articles of their faith while serving in the military.
For 30 years, Sikh members of the military were not allowed to practice core tenets of their face, including unshaven hair and turbans.
In 2017, eight years after the Sikh Coalition began its campaign to end the US military's ban on certain religious practices restricting Sikh members, the Army updated its rules governing religious liberties.
""I am immensely proud of (Second Lieutenant) Narang for seeing her goal through and, in doing so, breaking a barrier for any Sikh American who wishes to serve,"" said US Army Captain Simratpal Singh in a statement. ""The broader acceptance of Sikh service members among all of the service branches, as well as in top tier leadership spaces like West Point, will continue to benefit not just the rights of religious minority individuals, but the strength and diversity of the US military."" President Donald Trump on Saturday addressed the 1,107 graduates, including Narang, who gathered for the academy's annual commencement.
Graduates socially distanced 6 feet from one another across the Plain Parade Field to accommodate Covid-19 public health requirements instead congregating at Michie Stadium, the ceremony's traditional location. Family and friends were not allowed to attend the ceremony but could watch it online.
""This premier military academy produces only the best of the best -- the strongest of the strong -- and the bravest of the brave. West Point is a universal symbol of American gallantry, loyalty, devotion, discipline, and skill,"" Trump began his address, reading from a teleprompter.
""To the 1,107 who today become the newest officers in the most exceptional Army ever to take the field of battle, I am here to offer America's salute. Thank you for answering your nation's call,"" he added.
Narang will complete her Basic Officer Leadership Course at Fort Sill in Lawton, Oklahoma. She will then head to her first posting in Okinawa, Japan in January 2021.","Tuesday, March 31, 2020"
"Satellite images of hospital parking lots in Wuhan, China, as well as internet search trends, suggest the coronavirus may have been spreading in China as early as last August, according to a new study from Harvard Medical School.

The study, which has not yet been peer-viewed, found a significantly higher number of cars in parking lots at five Wuhan hospitals in the late summer and fall of 2019 compared to a year earlier; and an uptick in searches of keywords associated with an infectious disease on China's Baidu search engine.
The reseachers note they can't directly link the traffic volume to the virus; even if there was an increase in traffic to hospitals, it doesn't mean a new virus was the cause. There has been no other evidence to show the virus was circulating in China in the late summer.
The timeline in the new paper suggests signs of the novel coronavirus outbreak emerged well before the currently understood start. The first cases in Wuhan were detected in mid-December, and Chinese officials reported cases of pneumonia to the World Health Organization on December 31. Chinese scientists identified the pathogen as a new strain of coronavirus on January 7.
WHO and China have faced criticism, including from President Donald Trump, of their handling of the virus early on.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Tuesday she she hadn't seen the research, ""but I think it's outrageously absurd if anyone comes to such conclusion only based on superficial elements like the traffic patterns,"" calling the research methods ""hardly watertight.""
""There have been so many conspiracy theories against China, which is so unfair,"" she said. ""The most pressing task for the international community at this moment is to do everything to control the spread of the pandemic and save more lives.""","Sunday, March 15, 2020"
"US intelligence officials were warning as far back as late November that the novel coronavirus was spreading through China's Wuhan region and posing a threat to its people and daily life, according to ABC News.

The US military's National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI) compiled a November intelligence report in which ""analysts concluded it could be a cataclysmic event,"" one of the sources of the NCMI's report told ABC News.
The source told ABC News that the intelligence report was then briefed ""multiple times"" to the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's Joint Staff and the White House.
Repeated briefings were held through December across the US government, including the National Security Council, culminating in a detailed outline of the threat in the President's Daily Brief in early January, according to ABC News, whose report cited four sources briefed on the matter. The report, which CNN has not independently verified, raised concerns because of the disease's potential threat to US military forces in Asia, ABC News reported.
NCMI denied the existence of the report later Wednesday, saying that ""no such NCMI product exists.""
""As a matter of practice the National Center for Medical Intelligence does not comment publicly on specific intelligence matters,"" said Colonel Dr. R. Shane Day, the director of the NCMI, in a statement.
""However, in the interest of transparency during this current public health crisis, we can confirm that media reporting about the existence/release of a National Center for Medical Intelligence Coronavirus-related product/assessment in November of 2019 is not correct. No such NCMI product exists,"" Day added.
CNN is seeking a response from the White House National Security Council and the Pentagon. The Pentagon, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and White House National Security Council declined to comment to ABC News.
The Trump administration has faced criticism for not responding quickly enough to contain the novel coronavirus in the US, which now has the most confirmed cases globally. The intelligence report is the latest indication that the Trump administration had prior warning of the virus well before the first case was confirmed in the US in late January and further undercuts President Donald Trump's claims that the crisis was an unforeseen and unexpected problem. US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said Sunday that he couldn't recall if the Pentagon received an intelligence assessment on the novel coronavirus in China last November from the NCMI, which provides medical intelligence to the Defense Department on foreign health threats and capabilities.
""But we have many people that watch this closely. We have the premier infectious disease research institute in America, within the United States Army. So, our people who work these issues directly watch this all the time,"" Esper said Sunday during an interview on ABC News' ""This Week.""
When pressed further by ABC's George Stephanopoulos if he had known if there was a briefing to the National Security Council, Esper replied that he was unaware.
""Yes, I'm not aware of that. ... We got to be prepared for any type of contingency or any type of war fighting environment that we may be operating in. That's why we've been poised and ready to support the whole of government effort."" Trump has repeatedly praised his administration's efforts to slow the spread of coronavirus in the US, pointing to his January 31 decision to restrict travel from China. But he initially downplayed the severity of Covid-19 and has repeatedly insisted that no one predicted a pandemic crisis like the one caused by coronavirus.
""Nobody knew there'd be a pandemic or an epidemic of this proportion,"" Trump said March 19 at the White House.
But the Washington Post reported that Trump and Congress ignored reports from US intelligence agencies starting in January that warned of the scale and intensity of the coronavirus outbreak in China. And Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro warned internally in a memo in late January that the coronavirus could develop into a ""full-blown pandemic,"" risking the health of millions and trillions of dollars in economic losses, CNN previously reported.
Navarro warned in a second memo less than a month later that the risk of a pandemic was rising and urged the White House's coronavirus task force to secure billions in supplemental spending. Both memos were first reported by The New York Times and Axios.

"On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell went public with what has long been suspected: He has no plans to leave the Senate even if his party loses its majority in November.

""I do,"" McConnell tersely responded to Politico when asked if he would seek to stay as the highest-ranking Republican in the Senate no matter what happens in the 2020 election. (All of that assumes that McConnell is reelected to a seventh term in November, and his colleagues are willing to support him as leader going forward. Both seem likely at least at the moment.)
Obviously, McConnell would prefer to spend his next few years in the Senate as the majority leader. But if Republicans lose the majority this fall -- a prospect that looks decidedly plausible at the moment -- then McConnell seems likely to spend much of his eighth decade as the head of the minority rather than the majority.
The reason for that reality is simple: While the 2020 Senate map isn't great for Republicans, the 2022 map is far worse -- making it extremely likely that if the GOP loses the majority this fall they may not have a real chance to regain it for at least two more election cycles.
The 2020 map is daunting on its face. Republicans have to defend 23 seats to just 12 for Democrats.
But of those 23 GOP-held seats, Hillary Clinton carried only two -- Colorado and Maine in 2016. (Clinton won Maine's statewide electoral votes but Donald Trump got a single electoral vote for carrying the state's second district.) Which means that for Democrats to win back the majority, they need to net three seats (if Joe Biden wins the White House) or four seats (if President Donald Trump wins re-election) in states that are generally friendly to their party.
The road to the majority in 2020 for Democrats runs though places like Arizona, North Carolina, Iowa, Montana and maybe even Kansas. It's not terrible territory for Democrats. But it's not friendly territory either.
And while they don't have many problem seats of their own, Democrats have to try to get Alabama Sen. Doug Jones re-elected -- an extremely difficult task in a presidential election year in such a Republican state.
Now take a look at the 2022 map. Again, the raw numbers favor Democrats; Republicans have 22 seats up to just 12 for Democrats.
But unlike 2020, the political tilt of those 22 Republicans seats are much more favorable to Democrats.
Republicans will likely need to reelect incumbents in Pennsylvania, Florida, Wisconsin -- three very swing-y seats. In addition, they could well be facing difficult open-seat races in North Carolina (Sen. Richard Burr said that his 2016 reelection race would be his last) and Iowa (Sen. Chuck Grassley would be 89 if he ran for an eighth term in 2022). And two races involving appointed Republican senators -- Arizona's Martha McSally and Kelly Loeffler in Georgia -- in 2020 will also be on the 2022 ballot. (Both are running this November for the unexpired two years on the terms they filled.) If Democrats come up short against Loeffler or McSally -- or both -- this November, you can be sure the party will heavily target them in 2022, as they represent states where demographic changes are moving in Democrats' favor.
Conversely, Democrats have almost no weakness among the dozen of their incumbents set to be on the ballot in 2022. The only obvious targets are Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (Nevada) and Maggie Hassan (New Hampshire) as both are in their first terms in the Senate and represent swing-ish states. But neither is likely to get caught unawares, and both are regarded as solid politicians. Beyond that duo, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet might be a GOP target. But even if Democrats are hit with retirements or open seats -- California Sen. Kamala Harris might be vice president by the time her term comes up in 2022, while Sen. Patrick Leahy will be 82 years old -- those vacancies are in solidly Democratic states.
Add it all up and you get this: If McConnell and Republicans lose the Senate majority this November, they might not have a realistic chance to win it back until 2025. Which is a long time for McConnell to wait to regain his position of power.","Wednesday, February 12, 2020"
"Top Senate Republicans are not embracing the assertion by a top White House adviser that President Donald Trump wants Congress to approve another $2 trillion worth of stimulus to help bolster the economy.

Walking off the floor, CNN asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell if he could back a $2 trillion plan as White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said Trump is seeking in the next round of stimulus.
""Well, as I've already said, we'll be looking in July to make a decision about whether to go forward with another rescue package,"" McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said Monday. ""And we'll let you know.""
McConnell didn't respond to a question when asked if he's concerned such a price tag could grow the deficit.
Asked about the $2 trillion price tag, Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley said Monday that senators still need to assess how the existing stimulus dollars -- nearly $3 trillion worth -- have been spent to determine what additional legislation is needed. Grassley said there are still outstanding questions about how the economy has been impacted by Covid-19, how $150 billion already given to states and localities is being spent and how health care money has been handled.
""By the way, there's going to be some bill next time,"" said Grassley, an Iowa Republican. ""There's no doubt about that as far as I can tell.""
Asked if he backs a payroll tax cut as Trump has sought, Grassley said: ""It seems to me -- if it's just til the end of the year, I don't know whether it will do the good.""
Grassley said Congress needs to ""spend greater time"" to ""transitioning people"" who may soon see their enhanced unemployment benefits dry up.
On Saturday, Navarro said Trump wants a new package of ""at least $2 trillion dollars that is strategically focused around the President's two simple rules -- Buy American, Hire American -- along with incentives for American companies to bring offshored jobs back home.""","Monday, January 27, 2020"
